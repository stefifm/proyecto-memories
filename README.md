# issues

Google Login stop working after the deploy. I tried everything that said from the web (stackoverflow) but nothing happened.

# Resources
- MongoDB Atlas
- React
- Node
- Express

# Languages
- Javascript

# UPDATE
Finally, the Google Login works!!!! I don't know the reasons behind of it. It looks like you have to wait a little bit until the changes on the Google Console makes effect.
